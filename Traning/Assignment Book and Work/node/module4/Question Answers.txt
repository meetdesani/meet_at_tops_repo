What is difference between mongo DB and SQL?

Answer: 
Database Type:

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't rely on a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) structure. Instead, it uses a flexible, schema-less document model.SQL databases, often referred to as relational databases, follow a structured, tabular format where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas.

MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model. Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, and collections (equivalent to tables in SQL) can contain different types of documents with varying fields.SQL databases use a table-based data model where each table has a predefined schema, and each row in the table represents a record with the same set of fields.

MongoDB is schema-less, meaning each document in a collection can have a different structure. Fields can be added or removed without affecting other documents in the collection.SQL databases have a predefined schema where the structure of the data is specified before data entry. Changes to the schema often require altering the table structure, which can be more rigid.

MongoDB uses a query language that is based on JSON-like documents. Queries are expressed in terms of the structure of the documents.SQL databases use the SQL language for querying, which is a standardized language for relational databases. SQL queries are written in a declarative style.
